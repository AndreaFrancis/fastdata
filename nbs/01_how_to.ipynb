    "Synthetic data has become a popular topic in the field of large language models (LLMs) recently with modern LLMs such as Meta's Llama 3 models being trained on a large portion of synthetic data. This blog post attempts to introduce synthetic data generation and showcase the important bits to consider when generating synthetic data."

    "## Synthetic Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to synthetic data in this blog post, we are referring to data that is generated by an LLM. Synthetic data has a number of benefits over other types of data such as web scraped data. The first and foremost is the controllability of the data. We can specify the type of data we want to generate, targetting specific tasks or languages, levels of difficulty, and even specific topics. We can also easily generate large amounts of data in a shorter amount of time due to the parallelizable nature of LLMs compared to using an annotation service such as [scale.ai](scale.ai). However, there are also some downsides to synthetic data. The first is that it is not always clear how to define the quality of the data. The second is that it can be difficult to generate diverse data which covers the long tail distribution of real world knowledge. The third is that it can be difficult to ensure that the data is faithfully represents the real world, i.e., does not contain hallucinations. Additionally, there are some concerns that training on synthetic data can lead to model collapse. For example, the awesome paper [The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493) showed that consecutively training a model on data generated from itself leads to the model forgetting the original training data and devolving into nonsense. This blog post will discuss and demonstrate many lessons learned in the field of synthetic data generation.\n",

    "## Important Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most important components behind data is quality and diversity. These two components sadly can be in conflict with each other. For example, a random string generator will give you a ton of diversity, but the quality will be low. On the other hand, looking at Encyclopedia Britannica, you will find high quality articles of various topics, but they will all be written in a similar style to each other and will lack depth on many topics such as mathematics or will not contain any content on others such as fan fictions of popular tv shows, movies and novels.\n",

    "## How to Nail the Important Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with diversity since it is the simplest, especially due to how LLMs work. LLMs at their core are a probability distribution of possible words given previous words in a sequence with words that often come after other words being more probable in this probability distribution. We can easily sample from and manipulate this distribution to cover as much of the language space as we want. A recent popular method to do this is to bias the distribution using topics or personas that lead the LLM to generate words in the direction of that topic or in the style of the given persona. This has a nice benefit of not degrading the quality of the generated text, which can happen with other methods such as increasing the temperature of a given sampling method as discussed in [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751) by Holtzman et. al. Here is an example of the persona approach in action from the recently released paper [Scaling Synthetic Data Creation with 1,000,000,000 Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20094v1) by Chan et. al. Now this sadly only solves one aspect of diversity, that of breath. There is however, a depth associated with diversity which I think is best expressed in the paper [WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244) by Xu et. al. In this paper, the authors evolve seed instructions in terms of breath, the type of topics used for an instruction, and depth, the complexity of the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, diversity, check! How about quality? Unfortunately quality is a lot more fickled than diversity in this context. For example, high quality can refer to how well a particular text is written, it could refer to the accuracy of the information presented in the text (e.g., a mathematical proof), the readability of the text, etc. An analogy that might help encapsulate the issue is what happens with grading student exams. Usually, and especially for free form responses, the answer of the student is graded against a rubric that represents different characteristics to determine the quality of the answer. One method to try and improve quality is use personas where we specify a persona that is an expert in whatever data we seek to generate (e.g., `You are an expert senior level Python developer with deep knowledge of numpy and pandas`). However, this approach does not get around issues with hallucinations that LLMs are plagued with. Therefore, the approach I use most often is fixing in post (aka filtering). The idea is to initially generate a large diverse set of data and then find the bits and pieces that align with whatever notion (i.e., get a high score on your rubric) of quality you have for your data. For certain types of data such as code, we can use heuristics and simple filters such as whether the code compiles. However, for more abstract ideas of quality, we need to get more creative. One approach I quite like and have done a lot of work on is from the work [Textbooks Are All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644) by Gunasekar et. al. In this work, the authors show how you can use a strong large language model to classify code files as high or low quality where they defined quality as the educational content of the file. Filtering a large collection of code data for only high quality educational code resulted in fairly sizable bumps in downstream performance. This LLM filtering technique has been utilized in a number of other works such as [How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09668) and [The FineWeb Datasets: Decanting the Web for the Finest Text Data at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17557) to similar affects."

    "\n",
    "We find some interesting results from these experiments! The common theme is that training on synthetic data is better than training on random GitHub programs regardless of quality filtering as shown in Setup 1 and 2 and Setup 4 and 5. Also of note is that we are only able to improve over the baseline by a small margin when using high quality synthetic data as shown in Setup 4. All other setups degrade performance, especially Setup 5, which is training on only high quality GitHub programs and a bit surprising as much research has gone into showing high quality data is better for training. More investigation will be needed to see why this is the case, but one possibility is that the scoring system is not as good these GitHub programs as the synthetic programs or it could be due to a lack of diversity in the GitHub programs.\n",

    "Alright, so what are the key takeaways I want you to leave with? The first is that both quality and diversity are very important aspects when it comes to synthetic data and can make or break models trained on this data. The second is that, imo, quality by far is harder than diversity due to its multi-dimensional nature especially for free form content. And lastly, I'd like you to take away that synthetic data is a great tool to go to when you don't have a lot of data for your task. It's cheap and fast to create and when done correctly can boost performance on your task.\n",

    "The first paper that I remember reading on this topic was [Evolution through Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08896) by Lehman et. al. The problem they faced was generating a walker robot in the Sodarace domain that can move across a given terrain. These walker robots are defined in Python using a framework that was not seen by the model the authors used. To teach the model how to generate these walker robots python programs, they took a synthetic data approach. Since LLMs need a ton of data to learn, they first use a coding LLM to mutate existing programs in a genetic programming style to mutant/augment existing programs. They then finetune the LLM on these programs and use it to synthesize even more programs. They show that this process can be repeated to improve the models ability to generate walker robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from walk_creator import walker_creator\n",
    "...\n",
    "def make_walker():\n",
    "    wc = walker_creator()\n",
    "    # the main body is a square\n",
    "    sides = make_square(wc, 0, 0, 10, 10)\n",
    "    center = wc.add_joint(5, 5)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting paper from some of my colleagues is [Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13032) by Bradley et. al. This was where I really started to understand the connection among quality-diversity, artificial life and synthetic data for LLMs. Until this paper, I didn't really know about the work on QD algorithms, which I recently learned was pioneered by [Joel Lehman and Kenneth O. Stanley](https://quality-diversity.github.io/) (of course, I should have known smh). Compared to the standard genetic programming approaches that are purely an optimization problem attempting to find a single most fit solution, QD attempts to find a diverse set of solution, each with a high level of quality/fitness. Okay, back to the paper, this paper in particular is interesting as it shows how they show you can apply QD to tasks that are not easily measured for fitness such as creative writing by leveraging feedback from LLMs.\n",
